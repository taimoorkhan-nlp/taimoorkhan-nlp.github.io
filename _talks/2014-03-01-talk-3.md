The talk addressed German sexism detection as a multi-facet problem i.e., binary classification, multiple levels of sexism and their distribution. The proposed approach was based on a transformer based multi-task learning architecture to perform multiple classification using single model, while also benefiting from the shared common features for these classification tasks through the same architecture.
