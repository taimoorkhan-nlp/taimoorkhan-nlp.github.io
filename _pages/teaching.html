<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>My career in academia started in 2011 as a lecturer. Since beginning, I embraced teaching as a dynamic and collaborative process. My journey has taken me from foundational courses such as Introduction to Programming and Object-Oriented Analysis to advanced graduate-level topics like Machine learning, text mining, natural language processing and ML for data science. My teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of hands-on learning, where theoretical concepts are reinforced through practical demonstrations, projects, and real-world applications. During the courses, we discussed various problems faced in real-world e.g., basic level tools for local low resourced languages and make efforts to devise solutions for them where some ideas were later transformed into Master thesis. In a similar way, we developed tools during bachelorâ€™s project that were innovative and addressed the gap in applied research e.g., we developed the first Pashto text to speech model for some primitive sentences.</p>
<p>In programming courses, I design interactive lab sessions where students work on progressively challenging problems, fostering their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Similarly, in advanced courses like Social Network Analysis, I integrate benchmark datasets, encouraging students to apply trained methods, extract insights and interpret social dynamics. I made deliberate efforts to maintain a learner centered environment where the students are willing to contribute in, openly share their doubts and collaboratively engage in thought provoking discussions. Some of the ideas discussed during our Master course were later published in well reputed journals. During my job as Assistant professor, COVID restrictions were imposed where we had to switch to online model of teaching during the semester. It involved using online course management systems more actively than before, recording video lectures and even organizing online exams. Since then, I reached out to thousands of students across the globe through my online courses as well.
Ultimately, my goal is to empower students with a deep understanding of both foundational and cutting-edge concepts, equipping them to tackle challenges in academia and industry.</p>
