    <td>talk</td>
    <td>Meta-Rep 2024, Munich, Germany</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The talk highlighted the prevalence of AI/ML based models in computational social science and the need to improve reusability of latest models in the area. It requires transparency, reprdoucibility and ease of reuse to communicate knowledge across discipline and to wider audience in general.</td>

    <td>shared task (German sexism detection), KONVENS conference</td>
    <td>KONVENS 2024, Vienna, Austria</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The talk addressed German sexism detection as a multi-facet problem i.e., binary classification, multiple levels of sexism and their distribution. The proposed approach was based on a transformer based multi-task learning architecture to perform multiple classification using single model, while also benefiting from the shared common features for these classification tasks through the same architecture.</td>
