Hi, Iâ€™m M. Taimoor Khan, senior researcher (Big Data Analytics team), Knowledge technologies for social sciences (KTS) dept., at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany. I am working on reproducible AI methods for the social science use cases analyzing behavioral data from social media and other digital platforms. I contribute to strategy building, designing, management and development of research project on digital behavioral data analysis and transforming it into a useful service. I develop resources for the service and also build resources to facilitate and encourage community towards accessing, sharing and reusing computationally reproducible methods for social sciences.

My research interests are Natural language processing, Machine learning and adaptability with big evolving data leading to open-world analysis and novelty detection. My Ph.D. (Computer science) thesis title is "Lifelong machine learning topic modeling for large-scale aspect extraction". I have served in academia for over a decade, starting from 2011 and have taught different courses undergrad, grad and postgrad students in the computer science and data science degree programs. I have published in top-tier venues at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. I have also contributed to EU TIER2 project as a 3rd party project, collaborating on common standards and integrating complementary services. 

I have been actively involved in organizing conferences, workshops and symposiums and have serves on the review panels of various esteemed computer science conferences and journals.
