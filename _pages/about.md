Hi, Iâ€™m M. Taimoor Khan, PostDoc in Big Data Analytics team, Knowledge technologies for social sciences (KTS) dept., at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany. I contribute to in-house project to unite computationally reproducible methods for social sciences, under one platform.

My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. My Ph.D. is in computer science with thesis on lifelong machine learning models.

Contributed to setting up Big data infrastructure (Hadoop/Spark), EU TIER2 project on reproducible computational models and developing NLP tools for low-resource languages.

11 years experience in Academia, supervised BS/MS Thesis, co-organized research events and published at top-tier computer science venues.

Student researcher of the year (2016)
