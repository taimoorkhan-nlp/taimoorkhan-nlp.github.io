Hi, Iâ€™m M. Taimoor Khan, PostDoc in Big Data Analytics team, Knowledge technologies for social sciences (KTS) dept., at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany. I contribute to in-house project to unite computationally reproducible methods for social sciences, under one platform.

My research interests are at the intersection of ML and NLP. My Ph.D. is in computer science with thesis on lifelong machine learning models.

11 years experience in Academia, supervised BS/MS Thesis, co-organized research events and published at top-tier computer science venues.

I have hands-on experience of ML frameworks and the tools to build models in Python. I have also contributed to setting up big data infrastructure (Hadoop/Spark), building resource-kit for developing computationally reproducible models as part of EU project, and have developed tools for low-resource languages. 

In 2016, I won student researcher of the year award.
